joybutt is a  very simple C program that outputs to the stdout the button Id when a button or key is pressed on a event device (keyboard, mouse, joystick)

Can be useful to automate scripts using buttons or keys as input.
Has a very small footprint. This project is OpenWRT friendly.


If you plan to use joybutt for OpenWRT
use the Makefile in the root directory 

Otherwise, If you don't plan to use 
OpenWRT,  use the Makefile located in src.

Usage :
./joybutt -f /dev/input/event0

Joybutt will print on stdout button events 
triggered by the joystick in this form :

button_status TAB button#

key status :
0 = key pressed
1 = key released

Look src/joy.sh for a script example that uses joybutt.
joy.sh is compatible with the shell provided by busybox 
(on OpenWRT for example)
