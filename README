Joybutt is a  very simple C program that outputs to the stdout the button Id when a button is pressed on a joystick.

Can be useful to automate scripts using joystick's buttons as input.
Has a very small footprint. This project is OpenWRT friendly.


If you plan to use joybutt for OpenWRT
use the Makefile in the root directory 
and don't forget to do a make kernel_menuconfig and build 
the Joystick interface into the kernel.

Otherwise, If you don't plan to use 
OpenWRT,  use the Makefile located in src.

Usage :
./joybutt -f /dev/input/js0

Joybutt will print on stdout button events 
triggered by the joystick in this form :

button_status TAB button#

Button Status :
0 = button pressed
1 = button released

Look src/joy.sh for a script example that uses joybutt.
joy.sh is compatible with the shell provided by busybox 
(on OpenWRT for example)
